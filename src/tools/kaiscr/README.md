# KaiScr

## Small Python scripts to take screenshot from a KaiOS/FFOS device and to mirror the screen of your phone.

A video on how to use it from myself:

### kaiscr.py

Just run the script with `-h`:

```
python3 kaiscr.py -h
```

### kailive.py

Just run the script and make sure you have forwarded the debug socket
to port 6000(TCP):

```
python3 kailive.py
```

Press `q` to quit.
